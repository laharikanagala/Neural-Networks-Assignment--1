# Neural-Networks-Assignment--1
SHORT DESCRIPTION
To complete this assignment I have used join,replace, ifelif, split, pop, reverse methods . replace() is used to replace the string which we want to replace. join() is used to join the characters in the list to form a ring. i have used split() method to split the string into several list of characters. i have used pop() to remove the characters which we want to from the end of the list. Here i have used negative index powers because i want to remove the characters from the list at the last. i have used reverse function to reverse the string to get the desired output. I have used input() to get the the input from the user at time of running the code. whenever it is required i have typecasted the input string to get the integer value whenever it is needed in the question.
